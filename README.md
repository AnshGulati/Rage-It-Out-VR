# Rage-It-Out-VR
This repository contains a VR Rage Room project, built with Unity, offers an immersive stress-relief experience for India’s youth. It provides private, customizable VR environments where users can safely smash and interact with objects, serving as therapy for anger management and emotional challenges.

## 🚀 Overview
Rage-It-Out VR is an immersive Virtual Reality experience designed as a digital stress-relief solution for users seeking a safe outlet to release pent-up emotions. Set in destructible themed environments, players can grab virtual weapons like pistols, swords, fire hands, bows, and bats to smash, break, and destroy objects around them. With haptic feedback, immersive sound design, and realistic physics, the game delivers an emotionally satisfying way to cope with anger, anxiety, and stress.
In a world where mental health solutions are often stigmatized or inaccessible—especially among the younger population in India—Rage-It-Out VR offers a private, engaging, and therapeutic experience to help users decompress and reset emotionally.

## ❓ Problem Statement
